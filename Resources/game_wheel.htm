        <p>The Game Wheel is a new functionality in the Guess It Good game.</p>
        <p>After you have added the start-up data for player names, and number of games, pressing the "Start Game" button brings you to the Game Wheel screen. The announcer will speak the player's name who's turn it is. You must press the "Spin" button to get the wheel started spinning.</p>
        <p>You will hear the announcer speak the results of the spin.</p>
        <p>Your spin will land on one of the colored slices.  If the value of the slice is a number, then during that turn, you will get that number of points added to your score for every correctly guessed letter.  The total tally of your correct letter score will include the value of the spin plus the value of the letter.  Each consonant has a small positive value. Each vowel has a small negative value.  Your tally will include the math that includes all of these numbers.</p>
        <p>Scoring is tallied through all the games played.  That is, your score continues to grow until the last game in the selected number of games is solved. The winner is the player who has tallied the greatest number of points when the last puzzle in the series has been solved.</p>
        
        <p> There are three slices on the wheel that contain words.  These words are "BANKRUPT", "LOSE A TURN" and "CLUE". If you should land on Bankrupt, your entire game series score will go to zero, even if it's the first game or the last game in the series.</p>
        <p> If you land on "LOSE A TURN" your turn is forfeited and the next player continues with their turn.</p>
        <p> If you land on "CLUE" you will receive 1000 points for each correct letter guess during that turn and appearing on the gameboard screen will be  a button, appropriately named "CLUE" which you msut press to reveal a clue to the phrase in the puzzle. Once the first player lands on "CLUE" the word "CLUE" will be replaced with the number 1000.  From then on for this game, everyone that lands on the slice will receive 1000 points for every correct letter guess.</p>
