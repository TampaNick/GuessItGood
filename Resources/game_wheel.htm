        <p>The Game Wheel is a new functionality in the Guess It Good game, Version 2.</p>
        <p>After you have added the start-up data for player names, and number of games, pressing the "Start Game" button brings you to the Game Wheel <img width="224" height="412" src="GameWheel.png" align="left" hspace="12">screen. </p>
        <p> When your turn is called, press the "Spin" button. The wheel will spin and lan on one of the colored slices.</p>
        <p> If you land on a numbered slice, then your score will use this number value as the basis for the scoring calculation.  It depends on what letter you guess as to how this value is applied to your round score.  See the Gameboard secion of the user guide for more details on scoring.</p>
        <p> There are three slices on the wheel that contain words.  These words are "BANKRUPT", "LOSE A TURN" and "CLUE". If you should land on Bankrupt, your Round score will go to zero.</p>
        <p> If you land on "LOSE A TURN" your turn is forfeited and the next player continues with their turn.</p>
        <p> If you land on "CLUE" you will receive 1000 points for each correct letter guess during that turn and appearing on the gameboard screen will be  a button, appropriately named "CLUE" which you must press to reveal a clue to the phrase in the puzzle. Once the first player lands on "CLUE" the word "CLUE" will be replaced with the number 1000.  The "CLUE" slice will be replaced and appear on the wheel at the start of the next game.</p>
