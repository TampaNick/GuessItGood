    <p><b><span style="font-size:30.0pt;font-family:'Calibri Light',sans-serif;text-transform:uppercase">Game Wheel</span></b></p>
        <p>The Game Wheel is a new functionality in the Guess It Good game, Version 2.</p>
        <p>After you have added the start-up data for player names, and number of games, pressing the "Start Game" button brings you to the Game Wheel <img width="224" height="412" src="GameWheel.png" align="left" hspace="12">screen. </p>
        <p> First, a little explanation about scoring.  Scoring is recorded on the game board screen.  On that screen, you will see the players names, their cumulative scores and their "Round" scores in three lines in each person's blue scoring boxes at the top of the screen.  The Cumulative score is the total points of all winning rounds. The Round score is the current score for the round you are playing.   At the end of the series, the highest Cumulative points scorer is the overall series winner.</p>
        <p>The announcer will speak the player's name who starts first. They must press the "Spin" button to get the wheel started spinning.    Your spin will land on one of the colored slices.  If the value of the slice is a number, then during that turn, you will get that number of points added to your score for every correctly guessed letter.  The total tally of your correct letter score will include the value of the spin plus the value of the letter.  Each consonant has a small positive value. Each vowel has a small negative value.  Your sum for each spin on that turn will include the spin number plus the letter number.</p>
        <p> Scoring is tallied through all the turns of each game played.  When a round is over and that round's puzzle is solved, the winner of that round will be the player with the most points for that round. The winning player's round score wil be added to the previous cumulative score. All other players round scores will not add to their cumulative score and prior to the start of the next round all players round scores will be reset to zero.  </p>
        
        <p>Play continues through the remianing rounds and the winner is the player who has tallied the greatest number of points when the last puzzle in the series has been solved.  The announcer will call out the winner of each round and for the last round will call out the series winner too.</p>
        
        <p> There are three slices on the wheel that contain words.  These words are "BANKRUPT", "LOSE A TURN" and "CLUE". If you should land on Bankrupt, your Round score will go to zero.</p>
        <p> If you land on "LOSE A TURN" your turn is forfeited and the next player continues with their turn.</p>
        <p> If you land on "CLUE" you will receive 1000 points for each correct letter guess during that turn and appearing on the gameboard screen will be  a button, appropriately named "CLUE" which you msut press to reveal a clue to the phrase in the puzzle. Once the first player lands on "CLUE" the word "CLUE" will be replaced with the number 1000.  From then on for this game, everyone that lands on the slice will receive 1000 points for every correct letter guess.</p>
