<p>Guess It Good is a word game that can be played by one, two or three players.&nbsp; Play on iPhone or use iPhone mirroring to play the game on your television or computer screen so all players can see an enlarged version of the puzzles and screen display.</p>
<p>The main <img width="142" height="308" src="image002.jpg" align="right" hspace="12">game is to guess a word puzzle, which can be a word or phrase of varying size.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Players agree on the number of games they would like to enjoy at the start and enter that number as well as the number of players and a user name for each player.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press the Start Game button and you are brought into the gameboard screen, where you're greeted by original happy game theme music.&nbsp; The music will auto-stop as soon as you press a letter on the keyboard. You can use a Clue to help solve the puzzle by pressing the "CLUE" button when exposed, located just above the gameboard. This will present the Category which your phrase belongs to. Occasionally, you will hear game sounds like bells, buzzers or voices to guide you through the game. These can be turned off by sliding the blue Game Sounds toggle.</p>
