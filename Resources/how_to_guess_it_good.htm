<p><b><span style="font-size:30.0pt;font-family:'Calibri Light',sans-serif;text-transform:uppercase">How to Guess It Good</span></b></p>
<p>Guess It Good is a word game that can be played by one, two or three players.&nbsp; Play on iPhone or use iPhone mirroring to play the game on your <img width="144" height="312" src="GIG-Start.png" align="left" hspace="12">television or computer screen so all players can see an enlarged version of the puzzles and screen display.</p>
<p>The main object of the game is to guess a word puzzle, which can be a word or phrase of varying size.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Players agree on the number of games they would like to enjoy at the start and enter that number as well as the number of players and a user name for each player.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Press the Start Game button <img width="142" height="308" src="GIG-Games.png" align="right" hspace="12">and you are brought into the Game Wheel screen, where you're greeted by original happy game theme music.&nbsp; Press the Spin button on the Game Wheel screen and the wheel will spin until it stops on a value.  The value can be a number, which will add to your score if you select a letter on the gameboard that is included in the puzzle phrase.</p>
    <p>You may land on any of three words; <img width="142" height="308" src="GIG-GameWheel.png" align="left" hspace="12">"BANKRUPT", "LOSE A TURN" or "CLUE". BANKRUPT makes your current round's points go to zero. LOSE A TURN makes you lose that turn. The first player to land on CLUE earns 1000 points for correct letter guesses and exposes the CLUE button on the gameboard.  Tapping the CLUE button when it appears on the gameboard will give a clue about the puzzle. After it is used, the CLUE slice becomes a 1000-point wedge for the rest of that round's spins.</p>
    <p> When the wheel stops on a value, the announcer will speak the value and you are then transported to the main Game Board screen.<img width="142" height="308" src="GIG-Gameboard.png" align="right" hspace="12"></p>
    <p>You can find details about the game board in that section of the hamburger menu.</p>
    
    <p>The music will auto-stop as soon as you press a letter on the keyboard. Occasionally, you will hear game sounds like bells, buzzers or voices to guide you through the game. These can be turned off by tapping the blue "Game Sounds" toggle and/or the green "Voice" toggle"".</p>
    <p> The game continues with each player taking their turns to spin and guess a letter to solve the puzzle. When the puzzle is solved, the round ends and  <img width="142" height="308" src="GIG-Scores.png" align="left" hspace="12">the next round begins.  The winner of the round keeps all of the points he/she scored during that round and is added to their cumulative score. The cumulative score is the total score for all rounds and is stored as the number just below the player's name in the blue scoring boxes at the top of the game board screen. All players start each round with their ROUND score at zero but their cumulative points are retained. The ROUND score is shown in the scoring box after the word "Round:" If you have not turned off the Voice, the announcer will announnce the round winner's name and the series winner's name as the games end. The player with the highest cumulative score at the end of all rounds is declared the winner.</p>
        <p> Once all of the games in the series have been played, you can continue playing by selecting the glowing "Play Again" button, which will bring you to the start screen to setup your players and number of games.</p>
