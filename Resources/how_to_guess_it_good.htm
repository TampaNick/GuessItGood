<p>Guess It Good is a word game that can be played by one, two or three players.&nbsp; Play on iPhone or use iPhone mirroring to play the game on your television or computer screen so all players can see an enlarged version of the puzzles and screen display.</p>
<p>The main <img width="142" height="308" src="image002.jpg" align="right" hspace="12">object of the game is to guess a word puzzle, which can be a word or phrase of varying size.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Players agree on the number of games they would like to enjoy at the start and enter that number as well as the number of players and a user name for each player.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press the Start Game button and you are brought into the Game Wheel screen, where you're greeted by original happy game theme music.&nbsp; Press the Spin button on the Game Wheel screen and the wheel will spin until it stops on a value.  The value can be a number, which will add to your score if you select a letter on the gameboard that is included in the puzzle phrase.</p>
<p>You may land on any of three words; Bankrupt, Lose a Turn and CLUE. Bankrupt makes your total points go to zero. Lose a Turn makes you lose that turn. CLUE exposes the CLUE button on the gameboard.  The first player to land on CLUE can open the CLUE button by pressing it when the gameboard appears.</p>
<p> When the wheel stops on a value, the announcer will speak the value and you are then transported to the main Game Board screen.</p>
<p>You can find details about the game board in that section of the hamburger menu.</p>

<p>The music will auto-stop as soon as you press a letter on the keyboard. You can use a Clue to help solve the puzzle by pressing the "CLUE" button when exposed, located just above the gameboard. This will present the Category which your phrase belongs to. Occasionally, you will hear game sounds like bells, buzzers or voices to guide you through the game. These can be turned off by sliding the blue Game Sounds toggle.</p>
