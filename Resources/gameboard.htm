<p><b><span style="text-transform:uppercase">The Gameboard</span>:</b></p>
<p><img width="142" height="307" src="image003.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Game Board">The game board section has a header section, a gameboard, a custom keyboard and buttons to solve the puzzle, play a new round of games or toggle the game sounds and voice prompts on or off.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-transform:uppercase">The Features:</span></b></p>
<p><b>Header section:</b></p>
<p>At the top of the header section, you'll find the players' names and scores.&nbsp; Each time a player gets a letter right they score points that are tallied in this section.</p>
<p>Just below the scores is a message about who's turn it is and just below that is the Category hint about the phrase you are trying to solve. There is a game voice who we fondly call MC (master of ceremonies). MC will give you verbal announcements about Categories, letters, number of letters and the series winner.&nbsp; These voice announcements can be turned off if you so desire, by clicking the green Voice toggle.</p>
<p>The custom keyboard has blue keys when not guessed, has orange keys when pressed and have grey keys after Enter is pressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each correct letter guess earns 250 points for each correct letter, except for vowels. Each vowel takes away 10 points if selected. Correct guesses allow the player to keep guessing until they are wrong or solve the puzzle.&nbsp; When a player guesses wrong, the turn passes on to the next player.</p>
<p><span style="text-transform:uppercase"><b>Gameboard section:</b></span><img width="128" height="278" src="image004.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Solve Puzzle Pop-Up"></p>
<p>After the first correct guess, anytime a player thinks they can solve the puzzle when it's their turn, they would press the green Solve Button. This opens up a field where you can type or speak your guess. You then check, correct and submit your guessed phrase. If correct, you get all of the points for unguessed letters and do not lose points for any vowels remaining. If there are more games to play, the game will automatically load them as they are solved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The player with the highest score after all puzzles are solved is the series <img width="129" height="281" src="image005.jpg" align="right" hspace="12">winner. And it's easy to see who has the most points because the game records them for you.&nbsp; The game announcer will also speak out a message to congratulate the winner by name. To play again, press the now activated, red Play Again button.</p>
<p>Have Fun and thanks for playing!</p>
